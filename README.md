# EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU: I2C multi-master

This PMG1 code example demonstrates how to configure an SCB in I2C master-slave configuration to send and receive I2C data and toggle the state of the onboard LEDs. The PMG1 SCB when configured in master-slave mode can act as both master and slave. By default the I2C interface acts as a slave .When the user button on the kit is pressed , the I2C interface switches to master mode and sends the LED state  to the partner device . I2C interfce becomes slave again after the data is transmitted. A second PMG1 Kit is recommended for testing this code example.

## Hardware setup

A kit listed in [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) runs this code example and a second PMG1 kit, loaded with this same code example (but with a different slave address, as mentioned in the [Operations](#operation) section) is recommended for testing this code example.

1. Use jumper wires to establish an I2C connection between the two PMG1 kits using the pin assignments for the different supported kits as follows:

      **Table 1. Pin connections for I2C**

      | PMG1 prototyping kit | SDA | SCL | Ground |
      | :-------------- | :--- | :--- | :----- |
      | PMG1-CY7110    | J7.7 | J7.6| J7.3 |
      | PMG1-CY7111    | J7.7 | J7.6| J7.3  |
      | PMG1-CY7112    | J7.7 | J7.6| J7.3  |
      | PMG1-CY7113    | J7.6 | J7.7 | J7.3  |

      Connect the SDA line of kit 1 to the SDA line of kit 2. Similarly, connect the SCL and ground lines.


2. If UART DEBUG PRINT messages are enabled, UART connection are needed. Pin connections for UART is as shown in the below table. For the following revisions of the PMG1 prototyping kits, connect the UART Tx and UART Rx lines from the PMG1 kit to J3.8 and J3.10 on KitProg3 respectively to establish a UART connection between KitProg3 and the PMG1 device.

      **Table 2. Pin connections for UART**

      | PMG1 kit | UART Tx | UART Rx |
      | :-------       | :------------ | :----------     |
      | PMG1-CY7110    | ---  | ---   |
      | PMG1-CY7111 (revision 2 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10 |
      | PMG1-CY7112 (revision 2 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10 |
      | PMG1-CY7113 (revision 3 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10 |


      **Notes:**

      - All prototyping kits with a higher revision have UART lines internally connected. Therefore, external wiring is not required.

      - UART is disabled for PMG1-S0 kit in this code example because both the kit UART (P1.2 and P1.3 with hardware connection to KitProg) and the kit I2C (P2.2 and P2.3 with onboard pull-ups) use the same SCB 1 block on the PMG1-S0 kit.

See the kit user guide for more details on configuring the board.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[I2C multi-master](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-multi-master)" application with the desired name "MyI2C multi-master" configured for the *PMG1-CY7111* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7111 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-multi-master --user-app-name MyI2Cmulti-master --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

Following example adds the PMG1-CY7111 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyI2Cmulti-master" --add-bsp-name PMG1-CY7111--add-bsp-version "latest-v3.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyI2Cmulti-master" --set-active-bsp APP_PMG1-CY7111
   ```

</details>

</details>


## Operation

1. Choose any two of the PMG1 prototyping kits from the [list of supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) and ensure that the steps listed in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section are completed.

2. Ensure that the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Connect the first PMG1 kit to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB Type-C port (J1). This cable is used for programming the PMG1 device and as a USB-UART bridge to the PC during operation.

4. Verify that the `PMG1_KIT_1_ADDRESS_ENABLE` macro in the *I2CMasterSlave.h* file is uncommented and make sure the `PMG1_KIT_2_ADDRESS_ENABLE` macro is commented out.

   **Figure 1. Kit address macro setting for kit 1**

   <img src = "images/macro-setting-1.png" width = "500"/>
   <br>

5. Program the PMG1 kit using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

6. After programming the first kit, disconnect the USB cable and change the position on the power selection jumper (J5) to 1-2 to power the kit through the PMG1 USB PD sink port (J10).

7. Now, for the second PMG1 kit, uncomment the `PMG1_KIT_2_ADDRESS_ENABLE` macro in the *I2CMasterSlave.h* file and ensure that the `PMG1_KIT_1_ADDRESS_ENABLE` macro is commented out.

   **Figure 2. Kit address macro setting for kit 2**

   <img src = "images/macro-setting-2.png" width = "500"/>
   <br>

8. Connect and program the second kit by using Step 5.

9. After programming the kits, disconnect the USB cable and change the position on the power selection jumper (J5) to 1-2 to power the kits through the PMG1 USB PD sink port (J10).

10. Confirm that the LED on the second kit toggles each time the user button on the first kit is pressed and vice versa.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector and the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 1-2.

See the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on CY7110 prototyping kit. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

In this code example, the PMG1 SCB block is configured as I2C in master-slave mode.

When the switch on one kit is pressed, the kit acts as the master and sends an I2C read command to the second kit. The second kit acts as the slave, and so sends the current state of the user LED on the slave. The master then sends the command to invert the state of the LED on the slave based on the current status of the LED read from the slave previously.

Both kits initially configure the I2C read buffer with the  `Header`, the `Kit BSP Number`, the `Status` of the LED, and a `Footer`. When a master triggers an I2C read operation, this I2C read buffer is used by the slave to respond back to the master.

The kit BSP number is used only to identify the PMG1 kit BSP of the master or slave that was addressed, when printing it to the UART terminal. THis is not used for any checks.

Figure 5 shows the firmware flowchart for the design.

**Figure 5. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/firmware_flowchart.png" width = "600"/>
<br>


SCB0 is used for I2C communication (except PMG1-S0 where SCB1 is used for I2C) and is configured for master-slave operation with the 'Store Config in Flash' option deselected. This allows the modification of the I2C configurations during run time. This is done for changing the slave address assigned for the kit from firmware (See line 117 in *I2CMasterSlave.c*).

**Figure 6. I2C configuration**

<img src = "images/i2c_configuration.png" width = "800"/>
<br>


### Packet format read by the master from the slave (status packet)

The master sends the I2C read command to read the current state of the LED on the second kit that acts as the slave. The read command will retrieve three bytes of data from the slave, which consist of a `Header`, the `Kit BSP Number` of the slave, the `Status` of the LED, and a `Footer`. The master decides the command to send to the slave to invert the state of the LED based on the `Status` read from the slave.

| Header  | BSP | Status | Footer  |
|------|------------|--------|------|
| 0xDC | KIT BSP Number | 0x76(LED OFF) or 0xE3(LED ON) | 0x89 |


### Packet format sent by the master to the slave (command packet)

The master writes the command packet (to the slave) to set the state of the slave LED based on the LED status packet read previously from the slave. To do this, the master populates the I2C write buffer with a `Header` followed by the `Kit BSP Number` of the master, `Command` to set or reset the LED state of the slave, and a `Footer`. This command packet is decoded by the slave which will then set the LED state according to the received command only if the header and footer are received correctly.

| Header  | BSP | Command | Footer  |
|------|------------|--------|------|
| 0xDC | KIT BSP Number | 0x76(LED OFF) or 0xE3(LED ON) | 0x89 |

SCB 2 (SCB 4 in case of PMG1-S3 kit) is initialized as UART to receive and send data from and to a terminal emulator. To implement the UART data transfer on the SCB hardware block, UART Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) APIs are used. The UART is initialized with the following settings:

- Baud rate: 115200
- Data width: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bit: 1
- The clock input of the block is connected to a 48-MHz PERI-derived clock

**Note:** SCB on the PMG1-S0 kit is not configured for UART operation in the code example.

### Compile-time configurations
The EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU I2C multi-master application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameters that can be turned ON/OFF through the *main.c* and *I2CMasterSlave.h* files.

 Macro name          | Description                           | Allowed values 
 :------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :------------- 
 `DEBUG_PRINT`     | Debug print macro to enable UART print <br> For S0 - Debug print will be always zero as SCB UART is not available | Should be set to 1u to enable <br> 0u to disable |
 `PMG1_KIT_1_ADDRESS_ENABLE`     | PMG1_KIT_1_ADDRESS_ENABLE is Uncommented and PMG1_KIT_2_ADDRESS_ENABLE is commented while programming the first Kit | ----------  |
 `PMG1_KIT_2_ADDRESS_ENABLE`     | PMG1_KIT_2_ADDRESS_ENABLE is Uncommented and PMG1_KIT_1_ADDRESS_ENABLE is commented while programming the second Kit | ----------  |
